12/10/2012 - branching to work on new structure of passing information through OSCdefs

12/13/2012 
	- done editing connections. still untested.
	- error handling for Ohm added



12/17/2012 - first round of error testing.

12/20/2012 - first round of error correction 
	- fixed what connections functions I could.

[ ]Global

   * [ ]figure out postln doubling bullshit
      * only in connections - check OSC page
      * also, see if control surface behaves differently than calling functions explicitly

[ ]Connections

   * [ ]note record not changing colors
   * [X]cascade record seems fine

   * [X]chord record keeps looping

   * [X]bassline 1 colors fucked royally

      * changed msg send to bassline two in bassline one loop
   * [X]granDelay toggle has sendMsG typo

   * [ ]attackRandomizer seems fine

   * [X]cascades not firing

      * sendMsG error - hopefully will work now.
   * [X]chordSum fucked

      * I think I got it.
   * [X]chords has sendMsG error

   * [ ]stabs toggle fires tempoClock for some ungodly reason

   * [X]micVerb toggle changes micVerb button

      * I think I got this one.
   * [ ]transport won't visually die

[ ]Boy

   * [ ]main bell fucked
      * in mainBell.scd - at not understood
   * [ ]main row fuzz good

   * [ ]low row fuzz loop is fucked somewhere

   * [ ]Random Bells fucked, makes craaaazy sound

      * at not understood
      * but w/ rowFuzz, sounds like some weird bus-stealing bullshit to me
   * [ ]bassline one fucked in stopping/starting

   * [ ]so is bassline two

   * [ ]bassline three changes colors, but doesn't work

   * [ ]noiseChords three missing a yield somewhere -- infinite loop!

   * [ ]trumpet toggle fucked

      * asInteger not understood in trumpetOhm
   * [ ]trumpet octave shift has infinite loop

   * [ ]accomp synth 3 doesn't change colors

   * [ ]no D# postln

   * [ ]aMajor doesn't change colors

   * [ ]cSharpMinor doesn't change colors
   * [ ]gSharpMinor doesn't change colors

   * [ ]none of these other fuckers change colors until BM and C# loop

[ ]Birds

   * [ ]bed kill fucked
   * [ ]infinite loop in eqgtr toggle

   * [ ]weird loop weirdness with tremgtr

   * [ ]killing the noiseSynth doesn't work
      * double toggle seems to fix it.
   * [ ]wobble synths both created and freed in one fell swoop

   * [ ]micVerb seems ok
