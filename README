[ ]Global

   * [ ]figure out postln doubling bullshit
      * only in connections - check OSC page
      * also, see if control surface behaves differently than calling functions explicitly
[ ]Connections

   * [ ]note record not changing colors
   * [X]cascade record seems fine

   * [X]chord record keeps looping

   * [X]bassline 1 colors fucked royally

      * changed msg send to bassline two in bassline one loop
   * [X]granDelay toggle has sendMsG typo

   * [ ]attackRandomizer seems fine

   * [X]cascades not firing

[ ]Boy

   * [X]main bell fucked
      * in mainBell.scd - at not understood
   * [X]low row fuzz loop is fucked somewhere

   * [ ]Random Bells fucked, makes craaaazy sound

      * but w/ rowFuzz, sounds like some weird bus-stealing bullshit to me
         * this one is a smidge confusing
   * [X]bassline one fucked in stopping/starting

   * [X]so is bassline two

   * [ ]bassline three changes colors, but doesn't work

      * maybe fixed
   * [X]noiseChords three missing a yield somewhere -- infinite loop!

   * [X]trumpet toggle fucked

      * this one is a bit baffling
         * nevermind.  GOTCHA

[ ]Birds

   * [X]bed kill fucked
   * [X]infinite loop in eqgtr toggle

   * [X]weird loop weirdness with tremgtr

   * [X]killing the noiseSynth doesn't work
      * double toggle seems to fix it.
